# In Development (not finished)

# v-rising-wine-docker-image

This docker image is supposed to run a v rising server.
At the time of writing the server is only available as a windows executable.
This project therefore uses wine to run the server executable.

# Configurations

The server can be configured using environment variables or by providing configuration files

## Using environment variables

## Using configuration files

For a fully custom experience, providing your own setting files is recommended. <br>
The files _ServerGameSettings.json_ and _ServerHostSettings.json_ must be present in the folder _/var/settings/_. <br>
It is possible to only provide one of these setting files. If this is the case, please note that a customisation using environment variables is still possible for the file, not provided. _Please be aware, that the required variables are still required, when you do not provide the ServerHostSettings.json file._ <br><br>

### Example files

Example files can be found [here](./examples), these contain the default settings by Stunlock Studios.

# Save File Location

The Save folder is /saves. In order to have access to the save files for an easy backup, mount a folder to /saves.
